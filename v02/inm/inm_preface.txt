<H>FOREWORD
<P>The Index to the Proper Names in the {%Mahābhārata%}
by Sörensen has long been out-of-print. Its want was
being felt by scholars interested in Indological studies
all over the world. In order that the book may be made
available in the market at a reasonable price, the
Ministry of Education have sponsored the reprinting of
the work by offset process under their scheme of re-
printing of important out-of-print Sanskrit works. I hope,
the reprint will go a long way towards facilitating
Indological studies, specially studies in the {%Mahābhārata.%}
<P>At the time when this indexing was attempted
by Sörensen, no critical edition of the {%Mahābhārata%} was
available. Now that the entire {%Mahābhārata%} has already
been critically edited by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research
Institute, it would be quite in the fitness of things if
someone undertakes the revision of the material presented
by the learned author in the present work in the light
of the material found in the critical edition. That
would perhaps be the best way of our honouring
Sörensen and his aspirations. I am quite sure, this
reprint will inspire such an undertaking in our country.
<P>I am deeply appreciative of the efforts of M/S
Motilal Banarsidass in bringing out this reprint expeditiously.

<H>{@PREFACE.@}
<NI>THE present work consists of two portions—the Index proper and the Concordance. The
Index deals mainly with the proper names occurring in the Mahābhārata. The student
should therefore first look for information under such headings as are {%names,%} and not under
narrative headings such as {@Indravijaya@} and the like.
<P>The paragraph references found under the names in the Index are given sometimes alone
[e.g. § 547], and sometimes with the addition of small italic letters [e.g. § 201{%b%}]. If there
is no such addition, the paragraphs (viz. abstracts or paraphrases of the text) are themselves
sections of the narrative, and given under the name in question, because the bearer of the
name is the principal actor. Such paragraph references, without small italic letters, are often
followed by a parenthesis. Thus, under the heading {@Agni,@} we find the quotation “§§ 254—260
(Khāṇḍavadah.).” Here the references are {%suggestive%} of a narrative which will be found in
full under the heading given within parenthesis, viz. Khāṇḍavadahanaparvan, and the name
in question, in this case Agni, is the name of one among several principal actors, so that it
would seem arbitrary to refer the narrative to him alone.
<P>A small italic letter after a paragraph reference and followed by a word within parenthesis
is used when the name to which it is added does not connote the principal actor or the chief item
of the narrative, but is only incidentally mentioned, though the reference is of interest for, and
solely, or at least chiefly, concerned with it. If further information is wanted it will have to
be looked for under the heading given within parenthesis, where the name in question is
mentioned, the small italic letter being added within parenthesis as a kind of cross-reference.
<P>Under {@Māhiṣmatī@} we thus find the quotation “§ 282{%b%} (Sahadeva)” followed by a remark
concerning Māhiṣmatī. Further particulars must then be looked for under {@Sahadeva,@} where
we read, “§ 282: From Kiṣkindhā Shd. marched towards Māhiṣmatī {%(b)%}…”
<P>A small Greek letter indicates that the reference is chiefly of interest on account of the
connection in which it occurs, and that further information will be found under the heading
referred to within parenthesis, where the same Greek letter has likewise been added, within
parenthesis, as a cross-reference.
<P>Take, for instance, the reference given under {@Duḥśāsana,@} “§ 83 (Ādivaṃśāv.) <lang n="greek"></lang>: I, {@63,@}
2447” (or, I, {@63<lang n="greek"></lang>,@} 2447). Similarly, we find under {@Duḥsaha,@} “§ 83 (Ādivaṃśāv.) <lang n="greek"></lang>: I, {@63,@}
2448.” These references show that Duḥśāsana and Duḥsaha are mentioned under the heading
{@Ādivaṃśāvatāraṇa,@} and that no immediate interest attaches to their being referred to in that
place. The statement made under {@Ādivaṃśāvatāraṇa@} runs, “§ 83: the 101 sons of
Dhṛtarāṣṭra…of whom 11 (<lang n="greek"></lang>)…are enumerated as mahārathas.” Here the
<lang n="greek"></lang> indicates that I have not thought it worth while to enumerate those 11 names (they must
accordingly be looked for in the Sanskrit texts), but the passage in question has been referred to
under the headings of each of them.
[Page-IV+ 42]
<P>To return to the quotation under {@Duḥśāsana,@} “83 (Ādivaṃśāv.) <lang n="greek"></lang>: I, {@63,@} 2447.”
<P>The figures {@63,@} 2447 refer to a passage where Duḥśāsana is actually mentioned.
<P>The small <lang n="greek"></lang> shows that the mention of his name presumably is of little or no general
importance, and may be practically neglected from a mythological or legendary point of view.
<P>If the reader nevertheless wishes to know the purport of the reference, the word given
within parenthesis shows that information will be found under {@Ādivaṃśāvatāraṇa,@} and {%one%}
inspection under that heading will show that Duḥśāsana is there only mentioned, among eleven
of Dhṛtarāṣṭra's sons, as a mahāratha.
<P>The heading {@Ādivaṃśāvatāraṇa,@} with or without {%one%} additional inspection of the
Concordance under § 83, will at once show the reader who in his memory has a general idea of
the contents of the Mahābhārata that the quotation has been taken from a kind of preface or
introduction to the principal narrative of the Epos, which is placed after the sections where, not
Vaiśampāyana, but Sauti is the speaker. According to his critical disposition he will, or will not,
draw conclusions from this fact.
<P>Mere comparisons have been marked by the addition of {%(iva)%} or the like.
<P>The signs *, **, †, (†), ††, and (††) have a critical value. I have not, of course, allowed
the book to be influenced by critical theories. I have only intended to draw attention to such
facts as seem to be of critical importance. According to his disposition, the reader may or may
not draw conclusions from those signs. The danger is that they may sometimes have been
omitted through inadvertence.
<P>The numbers of verses, in ordinary type, refer to the Calcutta edition; the numbers of
chapters, in {@clarendon type,@} to the Bombay text. By using the Concordance it will be possible,
with very little uncertainty, to calculate what verse in the Bombay edition corresponds to
a given one in the Calcutta Mahābhārata.
<P>The books are quoted in Roman numbers.
<P>The enumeration of verses is, except where the heading is marked by an asterisk, intended
to be complete, and I hope that it is so, at least with regard to all instances where there cannot
be any doubt that the heading occurs as a {%name.%} In such cases, on the other hand, where it
may have been a matter of subjective feeling during the reading whether a word should be
considered as a proper name or as a mere laudatory epithet, I fear that there may be some
incompleteness and inconsistency. Thus some synonyms of Agni and Arjuna, which will be
found in Mr. Holtzmann's lists, have not been registered
<P>There are also some other inconsistencies, sometimes voluntary, for the sake of convenience,
sometimes involuntary, due to the fact that my work has extended over a very great span of
time. These latter ones are faults for which I must ask indulgence, but I hope that they will
not cause any serious misunderstanding or inconvenience. I do not now venture to correct
them, lest the numerous cross-references should be imperilled.
<P>The numerous synonyms, such as {%Kirīṭin%} for {%Arjuna,%} have, as a rule, been put together
under the principal name; eg. {%Kirīṭin,%} etc., under {%Arjuna.%} Such denominations as {%Kaurava,%}
{%Kuruśreṣṭha,%} etc., have, however, been given separately in their proper places, the principal
aim to be held in view with regard to them clearly being to be able to know easily what
person is meant in each instance.
[Page-V+ 42]
<P>In the case of such synonyms, and of articles the contents of which are unimportant, I have
only quoted book and verse. In other cases I have usually also added reference to paragraph
and chapter. Take, for instance, under the heading {@Arjuna,@} the quotation § 613 (Gadāyuddh.),
IX, {@32—33: 33,@} 1890, 1921. Here the explanatory addition (Gadāyuddh.) refers the reader to
the heading {@Gadāyuddhaparvan,@} where a summary of the narrative in question will be found
under Book ix, chapters 32—33. The quotation {@33,@} 1890, 1921 indicates the places where the
name Arjuna actually occurs.
<P>In some cases the summary of the narrative has also, for the sake of convenience, been
repeated, in a more or less abridged form, under the special heading; thus, in our present case,
under Arjuna.
<P>In these, probably not very numerous, cases the reference to the paragraph is only necessary
in order to get an idea of the wider connection in which the quotation occurs. In other instances
the exposition must almost entirely be looked for in the paragraph quoted. Thus in the case of
the quotation §§ 254—260 (Khāṇḍavadah.), I, {@222—234,@} under the heading {@Arjuna.@} Here the
narrative will be found in §§ 254—260 under the heading Khāṇḍavadahanaparvan. By referring
to the Concordance, under the same paragraphs, the place which the narrative occupies in the
epic as a whole will immediately be seen.
<P>By arranging in numerical order, i.e. in the order of the Concordance, the paragraphs as
given in the Index, we should obtain a synopsis of the contents of the whole epic, in the
order of the original. Essentially the same result may be obtained from the article {@Arjuna,@}
where I have introduced more repetitions (i.e. statements which are also found under other
headings) than in any other article.
<P>With regard to repetitions, I have thought it more important to enable the reader to use
the Index conveniently and without unnecessary waste of time, than to save space. I have not,
therefore, strictly avoided them in the principal articles, though I have done so in most cases
by referring to paragraph articles and to the headings under which the quotations concerned
are first given.
<P>The text on which the Index is based is, on the whole, the Calcutta edition. Readings
from other sources (i.e. almost exclusively the Bombay edition) have only been noticed for
special reasons.
<P>In transliterating the Sanskrit words, it will be noticed that I have followed the order of
the Latin alphabet, without paying any attention to diacritical marks. I have adopted the usual
system of transliteration, with some modifications. Thus the palatal mute is given as {%c, ch%} being
reserved for the corresponding aspirate; {%j%} is the palatal media, and {%y%} the corresponding semi-
vowel. The palatal and cerebral {%s%}-sounds have been transliterated {%ś%} and {%ṣ%} respectively.
<P>The only exception from the strict adherence to the arrangement in accordance with the
Latin alphabet is that the letters {%ś%} and {%ṛ%} have been treated as separate letters and placed after
{%c%} and {%r%} respectively. This has been done because these sounds are often transliterated as {%ś%} and {%ṛi%}
respectively.
<P>IN THE CONCORDANCE it will be noticed that the mutual relationship between the two
divisions in paragraphs and chapters has been indicated in various ways. My principal aim has
here been to save space and trouble.
[Page-VI+ 25]
<P>{%Where the paragraphs are separated from the synopsis of chapters and verses, the headings to%}
{%which they belong in the Index have simply been printed after the other indications relating to them.%}
{%E.g.,%} § 19 ({%giving the contents of Mhbhr.%} I, {@5,@} 1—11) {%will be found under the heading%} ‘BHṚGU.’
{%Where the paragraphs are not so separated, it should be generally understood that the title of the minor%}
{%parvan to which a paragraph belongs is also the heading under which it will be found in the Index.%}
{%E.g.,%} § 249 ({%Mhbhr.%} I, {@215@}) {%under the heading%} ‘ARJUNAVANAVĀSAPARVAN.’ {%If this is not the case,%}
{%the paragraphs are to be found in the Index under the titles of those chapters of the parvan in question%}
{%which have been printed with spaced type. E.g.,%} § 177 ({%Mhbhr.%} I, {@113@}) {%under the heading%}
‘PĀṆḌUDIGVIJAYA,’ § 161 ({%Mhbhr.%} I, {@96@}) {%under the heading%} ‘MAHĀBHISHOPĀKHYĀNA,’ {%and not under%}
‘SAMBHAVAPARVAN.’
<P>My sincere thanks are due to those who have helped me with their advice or have in other
ways shown their interest in my work. In this connection I beg to mention Professor V. Fausböll,
Professor K. F. Geldner, Professor Ch. R. Lanman, Dr. Sten Konow, and Dr. G. A. Grierson.
The valuable suggestions made by Professor Lanman have, in many respects, left material
traces in the arrangement of the Index, and certainly rendered it much more convenient and
useful to the student than would otherwise have been the case. My young friend Mr. Elof
Olesen deserves my warmest thanks for the care and sagacity with which he has assisted
me in the revision of the manuscript.
<P>Finally, I tender my respectful thanks for the pecuniary assistance which has rendered the
compilation of this work possible, viz., the very liberal support which I have received from
the Carlsberg Fond at Copenhagen, and from the Danish Government and the Danish
Parliament.
