<HI>POSTSCRIPTUM
<P>The author of this work, the late Professor S. Sörensen (*23rd November, 1849—
<>†8th December, 1902), was an eminent Sanskrit scholar. While an undergraduate he
<>strenuously applied himself to the study of Classical Philology and Sanskrit at the
<>University of Copenhagen, where he became a pupil of J.N. Madvig and N.L. Westergaard.
<>In 1883 he took the degree of doctor of philosophy with a most valuable and comprehensive
<>dissertation on the “Mahābhārata and its Place in Indian Literature”, in which he made
<>an attempt at determining the oldest elements of that great epic. Unfortunately he
<>only obtained the professorship of Indian Philology in the Copenhagen University at an
<>advanced age. In 1902, a short time before his premature death, he succeeded V. Fausböll
<>in the only chair of Indian Philology in the Copenhagen University.
<P>He began to collect the materials for the present work as long ago as about the year
<>1880, and continued it under great difficulties and self-sacrifice. In the year 1902 the
<>work was so far advanced that he could commence printing, but only the first four sheets
<>(pages 1—32) had been put into type before his death. The manuscript of the preface, the
<>concordance, and pages 33—153 had been put into final shape by him, whilst the materials
<>for the rest of the work were left unrevised. In these circumstances it was resolved that
<>the work should be continued, and the revision and final preparation of the manuscript
<>was under the superintendence of the undersigned D. Andersen, committed to the under-
<>signed E. Olesen, who had already assisted the author for two years.
<P>During the further revision, however, it was found that the collection of the material
<>had partly been provisional, and some time had to be spent in completing it. Furthermore,
<>it was considered advisable to add a selection of the various readings from the Bombay
<>Edition. This accounts for the rather numerous Additions and Corrections. Several other
<>difficulties arose during the preparation and printing of the work, especially in the time of
<>the Great War, but they were all overcome and now we are amply rewarded for all our
<>efforts in being able to place the great work of our compatriot before the learned world
<P>Our sincere thanks are due to Professor Sten Konow and to Sir George A. Grierson,
<>who both of them have read all the proofs and given us many valuable hints. Also the
<>printers deserve our best thanks for their accurate and skilful work. No less thanks are due
<>to the publishers, who have been ready to carry out this far from lucrative undertaking.
<P>Finally, we acknowledge with the deepest gratitude the subventions which have been
<>granted by The Danish Government, The Carlsberg Fund, The Rask-Oersted Fund, and the
<>India Office, which gracefully granted its support to the undertaking in subscribing to
<>a number of copies.
